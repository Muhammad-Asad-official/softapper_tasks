App Development

Task 1: Create A login Page
Design a user-friendly login page for your hotel booking app, featuring fields for email/username
and password, with validation and error messaging for missing or incorrect information. Include a
'Forgot Password?' link and an option for users to 'Remember Me'. Upon submission, verify
credentials securely and redirect users to the main dashboard upon successful login. Additionally,
provide a link for new users to register. Ensure seamless functionality and clear feedback for a
smooth user experience.

Task 2: Add Navigation Drawer (Side menu)
Make your mobile app easier to use by adding a side menu (Navigation Drawer) with Flutter. This
lets users move around the app smoothly, switching between sections without any hassle. Keep
everything looking and working the same throughout the app, so users know what to expect. With
this feature, users can navigate effortlessly and enjoy a more convenient browsing experience.

Task 3: Design the Registration Form for any booking app
Create a user-friendly registration form where users can input their information. Include fields such
as:
• Full Name
• Email Address
• Password
• Confirm Password
• Phone Number
• Address
• Any additional information specific to the hotel's requirements (e.g., ID proof, emergency
contact)
